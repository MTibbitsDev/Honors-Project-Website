        <h1><i>Hobbies and Interests</i></h1>
      </div>
      <div class="row">One of the main things that got me interested in computers was playing video games as a kid. I always loved problem solving, so any game that allowed me to see a challenge, develop a strategy to overcome it, and defeat it was something I enjoyed. Additionally, I developed and strengthened some of my closest friendships through the bond of playing video games together, so games have always held a special place in my heart. My gaming history is long and varied, but some of my favorites have always been First Person Shooters and Strategy games. Here is a list of some of my favorite games today.</div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2><strong>Favorite Video Games</strong></h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Minecraft</li>
        <p>Probably my all time favorite game. Minecraft has stood the test of time since I was a kid and continues to hold up as my favorite game of all time. The amazing variety of updates and new things to do keeps the game fresh and hosting servers for my friends and I is an annual tradition for every big update.</p>
        <li>Europa Universalis IV</li>
        <p>I only really got into this game recently but I absolutely love it. History is one of my favorite subjects (besides computer science of course) and EUIV is a perfect historical sandbox ripe with a variety of fun and interesting situations to enjoy.</p>
        <li>Total War: Rome 2</li>
        <p>Another strategy game added to the list. The total war series is a master class of both military and grand strategy combined into one amazing simulator that I just can not get enough of.</p>
        <li>Escape From Tarkov</li>
        <p>Tarkov is a very unique game that combines looter shooter mechanics, realistic mil-sim, and RPG elements all into one. This game is the ultimate adrenaline rush and is currently one of my favorite games.</p>
      </ul>

      <div class="row">
        <h2><strong>Personal Finance</strong></h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">Along with my Software Engineering major at Miami, I also have a minor in Economics. Economics interests me because the theories and concepts apply to a multitude of real world scenarios. Listening to podcasts, researching stocks to pitch for Asset Management Club, and engaging in club discussions are some of the ways I try to further my knowledge in the field.</div>
