# Honors Project Website
A website about me created for my CSE 383 course as an Honors Project.
Page 1: My resume with expanded details.
Page 2: Some of my interests and hobbies.
Page 3: My stock and crypto portfolio. The API only allows me to do 5 requests/min so I only included my 5 biggest positions.
Page 4: Dodge JavaScript game. Use the arrow keys to move and dodge incoming triangles from the ceiling. You can change the amount of enemies that spawn, how fast they move, and how large they are.
